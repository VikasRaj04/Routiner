      <h2>Why Routiner Exists</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2025, I, Vikas Raj, was gearing up to work on an ambitious project
        that required learning multiple skills and careful planning. Starting in the
        last three months of 2024, I began acquiring these skills and preparing for
        the journey ahead. However, I soon faced significant challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn’t track my progress effectively and often forgot what tasks or lessons
        I needed to complete each day. Without a proper system to log my achievements
        and history, I found myself losing focus and motivation over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I searched for apps and tools to help me manage my learning and training, but
        most lacked the essential features I needed or were far too expensive. My primary
        requirement was simple: a calendar-based system where I could record and review my
        daily tasks and progress in an organized way.
      </p>
      <p>
        When no suitable solution was available, I resorted to using a notebook. However,
        maintaining it daily proved cumbersome, especially since my work was mostly digital.
        That’s when I decided to create my own app—a platform that would simplify habit
        tracking and progress monitoring, not just for me but for anyone facing similar struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Routiner was born—a tool designed to empower individuals to stay organized,
        track their progress, and remain motivated. Routiner continues to evolve with feedback
        from its users, ensuring it adapts to their needs, adds valuable features, and delivers
        the best experience possible.
