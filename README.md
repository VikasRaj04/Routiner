# Routiner - Habit Tracking App

## Overview

Routiner is a habit-tracking web application Iâ€™m building to track personal habits and help maintain consistency. The app is built with React, Redux, and Firebase to manage habit data and provide progress insights. It features habit management, streak tracking, and detailed progress reports.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the UI.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **Firebase**: For authentication (using Firebase Auth) and data management (using Firestore).
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
  
## Features
- **Habit Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete habits.
- **Streak Tracking**: Tracks how many consecutive days a habit has been completed.
- **Progress Reports**: Shows detailed reports of habit progress over time.
- **Guest Mode**: Allows exploration of the app without signing in.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile.
  
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. You will also need to set up a Firebase project to handle authentication and Firestore database.
